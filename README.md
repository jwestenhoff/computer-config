# Computer Config

During my usage of several operating systems like windows and ubuntu I am collecting helpful settings or installations scripts.

These scripts and settings are helpful if I configure fresh installations of the covered operating systems.



## Ubuntu Scripts

These installation scripts help me to install the software I use on ubuntu distributions much faster.

If you have any tips or recommendations don't hesitate and contact me or open an issue.
